# Scratch Archive

This directory contains scenario tests and scratch files from the pre-consolidation fold-* repositories.
These were preserved during the fold → coven rename (January 2026) since they weren't tracked in git.

## Contents

- `coven-gateway/` - Gateway integration tests (Go)
- `fold-agent/` - Agent scenario tests (Rust)
- `fold-human/` - Human agent scenarios (Go)
- `fold-packs/` - Pack e2e tests
- `fold-swarm/` - Swarm integration tests
- `fold-tui/` - TUI client scenarios

## Scenario Files

- `gateway-scenarios.jsonl` - Gateway test scenarios
- `agent-scenarios.jsonl` - Agent test scenarios
- `packs-scenarios.jsonl` - Pack test scenarios

## Notes

These files use the old "fold" naming. Update imports/references if adapting for coven.
